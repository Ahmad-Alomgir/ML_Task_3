# Medical Image Classification with CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify medical images into five categories:

Brain MRI
Chest CT
Abdomen CT
Hand X-ray
Chest X-ray
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a dataset containing 18,000+ RGB images of varying sizes. It incorporates preprocessing, data splitting, and evaluation to ensure robust performance.
